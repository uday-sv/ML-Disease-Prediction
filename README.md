# ML Disease Prediction Web App

üåê Deployed at: [https://ml-disease-prediction.onrender.com](https://ml-disease-prediction.onrender.com)

This project uses Flask to create a web application that predicts diseases based on symptoms using a pre-trained K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model.

## Overview

This repository contains the source code and assets for a Flask web application that predicts diseases based on symptoms provided by the user. It uses a machine learning model (KNN) trained on medical data to make predictions.

## Installation

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ML-Disease-Prediction.git
   cd ML-Disease-Prediction/Flask
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to view the application.

## Files and Directory Structure

- `app.py`: Main Flask application file.
- `templates/`: Contains HTML templates for different pages (`index.html`, `details.html`, `results.html`).
- `knn_model.pkl`: Pickled KNN machine learning model for disease prediction.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages required to run the application.

## Usage

1. Visit the deployed web app at [https://ml-disease-prediction.onrender.com](https://ml-disease-prediction.onrender.com).
2. Enter the symptoms you're experiencing into the form.
3. Click "Predict" to see the predicted disease based on the symptoms entered.

## Deployment

This project is deployed using Render.com. Any changes pushed to the main branch automatically trigger a new deployment.
